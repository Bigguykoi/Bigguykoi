  <summary>Skin stealer</summary><h5 align="center">
 @moonflowersilver, my ex friend, is actively using my pony for their colours... (   › ᎔　‹) IN SUMMARY; Me and Nyx got into an argument. I asked them to stop using my gift pony as a base because they ended up using it to make their friend a gift which I wasn't ok with at all. They responded aggressively with completely absurd arguments like, for example, 'a ton of people tint the same way as you and have almost the exact same style as you. ' and 'You do know what pseudo means, right? Pseudo literally means something or someone fake trying to pass off as the real thing or something fake or false. That's literally my current style. A fake version of yours.' Idk what the fuck hes trying to say here aside from his style is literally just mine in a fancy way. (TAKEN EXACTLY FROM TEXT) After this, he went as far as to show our dms to somebody I had a disagreement with a while back because they thought I copied their DR Strange pony because they had the same hair combo and apparently that's a criminal offense and I'm evil now. It was resolved AGES ago and I thought everything was settled but Nyx thought it'd be a fun idea to show them that I called them retarded (A slur I can reclaim and called them in a irritable state. Not justifying what I said, just explaining it.) with intent to turn them against me completely even though I expressed that I was sorry after saying that after they apologised on my atabook. After that they changed their names to shit targetting me, calling me uncreative, a skin stealer and that my skins were ugly. ADULTS btw. ('- '|||) Not calling them out because I feel liek they were dragged into it and I was pretty rude calling them a slur, but I did NOT copy u brochacho??? I USED THE HAIR FOR THE WHITE SIDEBURNSS HELLOOO

The faces are the exact same colour if u colourpick... : #4c5550 for the skin, #5e5d3e for the helmet, #544d40 for the cheeks and so on. His response was that I didn't own the colours or tinting style even though they were getting it off of MY pony? lol. This guy is still actively using my gift pony for colours and thinks it's OK. Just putting this out there until he finally decides to stop.
