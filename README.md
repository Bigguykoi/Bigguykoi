 @moonflowersilver, my ex friend, is actively using my pony for their colours... (   › ᎔　‹) IN SUMMARY; Me and Nyx got into an argument. I asked them to stop using my gift pony as a base because they ended up using it to make their friend a gift which I wasn't ok with at all. They responded aggressively with completely absurd arguments like, for example, 'a ton of people tint the same way as you and have almost the exact same style as you. ' and 'You do know what pseudo means, right? Pseudo literally means something or someone fake trying to pass off as the real thing or something fake or false. That's literally my current style. A fake version of yours.' Idk what the fuck hes trying to say here aside from his style is literally just mine in a fancy way.  ('- '|||) Anywho, Nyx is CONTINUING to use the gift as a base even after stating he's doing his ponies from scratch now?

The faces are the exact same colour if u colourpick... : #4c5550 for the skin, #5e5d3e for the helmet, #544d40 for the cheeks and so on. His response was that I didn't own the colours or tinting style even though they were getting it off of MY pony? lol. This guy is still actively using my gift pony for colours and thinks it's OK. Just putting this out there until he finally decides to stop.
